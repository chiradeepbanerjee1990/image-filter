# image-filter

The project uses OpenCV for image manipulation.
One sample app is being included to show how to use kotlin-openCV-filter Library. It's in initial stage. More functionality on the way!


# Kotlin-openCV-filter

The Library currently provides 3 basic functionality just by passing source bitmap and getting output bitmap. The aim of this library is to provide openCV calculation in more simpler way and getting the desired result. It will have room for more than 25 customizable inteligence filter set. Please stay tuned!

[1] Conversion of any RGB image to black and white image
[2] Image Smoothness by Gaussian Blurr technique (Customizable as per user needs)
[3] openCV provided generic blurr method manipulation (Customizable as per user needs)

Initialize the library by ProcessImage.getInstance(this) 

To initialize openCV library implement * openCVcallback *  interface
